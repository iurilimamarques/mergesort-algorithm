# mergesort-algorithm
## Introduction

The mergesort algorithm is faster than the others algorithms, the time complexity is always O(n logn) but as a down side the space complexity is compromised, that is it is always O(n). 

## Under the hood

Mergesort algorithm consists of dividing the array in half until we have a one element array, after reaching this base case the algorithm starts comparing the sorted arrays in such way that the number of camparisons is reduced and always gives us a time complexity of O(n logn).
